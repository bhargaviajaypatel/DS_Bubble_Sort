# DS_Bubble_Sort
In bubble sorting, consecutive adjacent pairs of elements in the array are compared with each other.
If the element at lower index is greater than the element at the higher index, the two elements are interchanged so that the smaller element is placed before the bigger one. 
This process is continued till the list of unsorted elements exhaust.
